## **🔧 How to Handle Different Asset Types**

### **Juan Medina's Base Game**: Fork + Modify
```bash
# This becomes your main repo
git fork https://github.com/juan-medina/godot-shootem-up.git
```

### **Asset Packs (Sprites, Audio)**: Download + Organize
```bash
# In your wizard-shmup/assets/ folder
mkdir -p wizard-sprites magic-effects fantasy-audio sources

# Download and extract asset packs
# Keep original folder names for attribution
```

### **Active Libraries (BulletUpHell)**: Git Submodule
```bash
# Only if you plan to use the advanced features
cd wizard-shmup
git submodule add https://github.com/Dark-Peace/BulletUpHell.git lib/bullethell
```

### **Reference Projects**: Clone Separately
```bash
# Outside your main project
mkdir ../shmup-references
cd ../shmup-references
git clone https://github.com/Firstject/godot-space-rpg.git
git clone https://github.com/mtimkovich/shmup.git  # For learning only
```

## **⚖️ Important: Attribution Strategy**

Create `CREDITS.md` immediately:
```markdown
# Wizard Shmup Credits

## Base Game Engine
- **Juan Medina's Godot Shoot'em Up** - https://github.com/juan-medina/godot-shootem-up
  - License: [Check Juan's license]
  - Modified for wizard theme

## Art Assets
- **Wizard Sprites** - Source: [specific itch.io/opengameart links]
- **Magic Effects** - Source: [specific sources]

## Audio
- **Fantasy Music** - Source: [specific sources]

## Development Tools
- **BulletUpHell Plugin** - https://github.com/Dark-Peace/BulletUpHell (if used)
```

## **🚀 Getting Started Commands**

```bash
# Step 1: Fork Juan's repo on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/godot-shootem-up.git wizard-shmup
cd wizard-shmup

# Step 2: Set up upstream and create working branch
git remote add upstream https://github.com/juan-medina/godot-shootem-up.git
git checkout -b wizard-conversion

# Step 3: Create asset folders
mkdir -p assets/{wizard-sprites,magic-effects,fantasy-audio,sources}
mkdir -p docs

# Step 4: Create attribution files
touch CREDITS.md docs/CONVERSION_LOG.md docs/ASSET_SOURCES.md

# Step 5: Test the original game works
# Open in Godot and run to ensure it works

# Step 6: Start converting!
```

## **🎯 Key Benefits of This Approach**

1. **Maintains Juan's excellent architecture** - Don't rebuild what works
2. **Clean attribution** - Proper credit to all sources
3. **Manageable scope** - Focus on art/theme conversion, not engine building
4. **Version control** - Track your changes while preserving original
5. **Legal compliance** - Proper licensing and attribution

This approach lets you have a **working wizard shmup within days** instead of months, while properly crediting all the amazing open source work you're building upon.
