## 🔧 **Development Tools & Workflow**

### **Recommended Workflow:**
1. **Start with Godot-based shmup** as foundation (ShmupWorks recommended)
2. **Asset replacement pipeline**: Create systematic approach to swap space assets for fantasy
3. **Incremental testing**: Test each system as you build to maintain playable state
4. **Version control**: Commit after each successful stage completion
5. **Community feedback**: Share progress with shmup development forums for advice

### **Key Success Factors:**
- **Focus on gameplay feel first** - movement and shooting should feel satisfying before adding complexity
- **Leverage existing systems** - Don't rebuild what's already working in open source projects
- **Maintain visual coherence** - Ensure all magical effects have consistent art style
- **Performance testing** - Bullet hell games need smooth 60fps performance
- **Audio-visual synergy** - Magic effects should sound as impressive as they look

This workflow leverages the extensive open source shmup ecosystem while systematically transforming it into your unique wizard-themed bullet hell experience!
